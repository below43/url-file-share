# URL File Share

URL File Share is a simple, client-side web application that allows users to upload a file, convert it to a Base64 string, and generate a shareable link. Since all operations are performed locally in your browser, your files is only ever transferred within the text you copy and share on your devices, ensuring maximum privacy and security.

- Upload a file and convert it to a Base64 string.
- Generate a shareable link with the file's metadata.
- Preview the file if it's an image.
- Display file metadata such as filename, file size, MIME type, and upload date.
- Provide warnings about URL length limitations in different browsers.
